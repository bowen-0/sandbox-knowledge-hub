# Sandbox Knowledge Hub — Wiki

> The structured knowledge layer for the *AI Innovation Sandbox Knowledge Hub* (GovTech Hackathon Switzerland 2026 · challenge by Canton Zürich).

This folder is the **substrate**. Each markdown file is one entity. The folder it lives in determines its type. The YAML frontmatter is the graph. Every claim cites a paragraph in a source PDF.

If you only read one other file: [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md). It defines the schema. If you only read two: also skim [`index.md`](index.md) — the auto-navigation across the whole wiki.

## What this is, in one paragraph

The Canton of Zürich runs the *Innovation Sandbox for Artificial Intelligence* — a regulatory + technical playground where public administration, businesses, and researchers pilot AI applications under real conditions. Across two phases (2022–2026) it produced ~13 detailed PDF reports. Those reports hold hard-won knowledge (legal frameworks, data access, organisational prerequisites, technical learnings) that today is locked inside static documents. **This wiki restructures that corpus as a navigable, citable, extensible knowledge base** so a non-technical administrator planning a new AI pilot can find what they need and trust where it came from.

The corpus is bounded but **the wiki is not**. New sources — papers, web pages, transcripts, news articles, future sandbox reports — can be added as first-class citizens. See `sources/` below.

| [`sources/`](sources/)           | One page per source artefact (PDF, URL, paper, video, transcript…). The citation backbone.                                                                                                                            | `type: source`, `source_type`, `path` *or* `url`, `language`, `year`             |

| [`pdfs/`](pdfs/)                 | The original source PDFs themselves, organised by language (`pdfs/de/`, `pdfs/en/`). Static assets, not pages — linked from each `sources/<slug>.md` via `path:` / `en_path:` and an inline **Read the report** link. | (binary assets — no frontmatter)                                                 |

> The seven page types above are a **starting set** chosen because they map cleanly onto what the source corpus actually contains. They are *conventions*, not enforcement. If a new pattern keeps appearing in 3+ pages, propose a new folder (see `CONVENTIONS.md` → "How to evolve the schema"). `pdfs/` is the only folder without page-type semantics — it's the static-asset companion to `sources/` and ships with the wiki when hosted as HTML.

## How to read this wiki

Three ways, depending on who you are:

**As a human** — browse by type (folders above), or follow `[[wikilinks]]` between pages. Each page is self-contained and reads like a Wikipedia article. Citations resolve to a specific paragraph in a source PDF.

**As an LLM / retrieval system answering a query** — start with [`QUERY.md`](QUERY.md). It contains the canonical answering procedure: read order, citation style, voice rules, gap-honesty. It auto-loads as a skill from [`.claude/skills/query/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/query/SKILL.md) when this folder is the working directory for Claude Code or the Claude Agent SDK. Then read [`index.md`](index.md) for the navigable inventory. Frontmatter (`type:`, `audience:`, `priority:`, `sector:`, `connects:`, `cross_cutting:`) is structured for filtering and retrieval reranking — use it.

**As an LLM / contributor adding a new source** — start with [`INGEST.md`](INGEST.md). It contains the canonical four-phase ingest procedure (READ → PLAN → EXECUTE → BOOKKEEP), the paragraph-anchored citation rules, and the page-template shape for each of the seven types. It auto-loads as a skill from [`.claude/skills/ingest/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/ingest/SKILL.md). **Recommended runtime: Cowork or local Claude Code** — the paragraph-anchoring step needs a real execution environment for the Docling pipeline. Claude.ai with the GitHub connector works for *editorial* operations on already-ingested sources (drafting a lesson from existing material, cross-references, prose tightening), but not for new PDF ingest.

**As a human SME or challenge owner who wants to contribute** — read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). It's the step-by-step handover doc: which runtime to pick (Cowork / Claude.ai Projects / ChatGPT), how to set it up from scratch, and what "correct ingest" looks like regardless of which runtime you used. INGEST is the contract; CONTRIBUTING is the operator's manual.

**As an agent / RAG / knowledge-base operator plugging this wiki into your own stack** — this wiki is designed to be **substrate-portable**. Clone the folder; point your consumer at it. Both procedures (`QUERY.md` / `.claude/skills/query/SKILL.md` for read-side, `INGEST.md` / `.claude/skills/ingest/SKILL.md` for write-side) ship with the corpus, so any downstream LLM consumer inherits the same discipline without bespoke prompt engineering on your side. For runtimes that can't walk folders dynamically (custom GPTs, Claude.ai Projects, raw single-shot API calls), paste the relevant procedure file as the system prompt and the relevant pages (or the generated bundle, when it exists) as context. The procedures are identical across runtimes; only the page-loading and tooling mechanism differs.

## How to add to this wiki

The canonical procedure lives in [`INGEST.md`](INGEST.md) — the four-phase READ → PLAN → EXECUTE → BOOKKEEP arc, with file-level templates and the citation-backbone rules. Read it (or invoke the `ingest` skill) before adding any source. The three common cases below are quick orientation; INGEST is the contract and [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) is the schema spec.

### Add a new source (PDF, paper, web page, video, transcript)
1. If it's a PDF, drop it into `pdfs/de/` or `pdfs/en/` (or `pdfs/<lang>/` for other languages). Other file types live in a sensible sibling folder under `pdfs/` (e.g. `pdfs/transcripts/`).
2. Create `sources/<slug>.md` with `type: source`, `source_type:` set to one of `pdf | url | paper | video | transcript | note`, plus `path` (for files, relative to the wiki root — e.g. `../pdfs/de/<slug>.pdf`) or `url` (for the web). Add a `**Read the report:**` link line under the H1 so HTML readers have a one-click way into the source.
3. Optionally write the paragraph-anchor index in the same file (only needed for PDFs you intend to cite paragraph-level).

### Add a lesson
1. Read the source. Identify an atomic, transferable claim.
2. Create `lessons/<slug>.md` with `type: lesson`, link to `project[]`, `concept[]`, `regulation[]`, `stakeholder[]`, and cite the source with paragraph anchor.
3. Use `[[wikilinks]]` in the body wherever you reference another wiki entity.

### Add a concept
1. Confirm it's not already in `concepts/`.
2. Create `concepts/<slug>.md` with `type: concept`, a one-paragraph definition, and `related[]` to nearby concepts.
3. If the concept comes from the booklet glossary, mark `canonical_source:` to the relevant page in the booklet — these definitions are authoritative.

If you're unsure which type a page should be, **open an issue** using the "Propose a new concept/tag" template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`). Patterns we haven't seen yet are the patterns worth talking about.

## What this is *not*

- **Not a chat interface.** That's a later layer. The wiki is the substrate; UIs sit on top.
- **Not a knowledge graph in a triple store.** The graph lives in YAML frontmatter and is *exportable* to JSON-LD / DuckDB / Neo4j on demand.
- **Not a database with enforced schema.** Frontmatter conventions are linted, not validated. Easier evolution > stricter typing during the formative phase.
- **Not the only place truth lives.** The German PDFs in [`pdfs/de/`](pdfs/de/) are the citation-authoritative ground truth. The wiki structures them; it does not replace them.

---

## File-naming conventions (quick)

- `kebab-case-slugs.md`, ASCII only, no spaces.
- For PDFs that have both DE and EN versions, the wiki uses the language-neutral slug (e.g. `building-permits.md`, not `building-permits-en.md`).
- Sources use the same slug as their underlying file: `sources/p2-building-permits.md` ↔ `pdfs/{de,en}/p2-building-permits.pdf`.

Full naming + frontmatter rules in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md).
