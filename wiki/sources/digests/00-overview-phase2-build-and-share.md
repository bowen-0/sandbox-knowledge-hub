**Topic**: Strategic framing of Phase II — ecosystem enablement, regulatory learning, real-world testing
**Published**: 2026 (final phase report)
**Source**: reports/de/00-overview-phase2-build-and-share.pdf (German) + reports/en/00-overview-phase2-build-and-share.pdf (English, *Build & Share — A Sandbox for Enabling the AI Ecosystem*, the official 28-page booklet shared by the challenge owner on 2026-05-28)
**Length**: 28 pages (both languages)

## Problem & context
After Phase I ("Play & Learn", 2022–2024) proved the sandbox model worked, Canton Zürich's *Standortförderung* (location promotion office, in the *Amt für Wirtschaft* / Office of Economic Affairs) needed to evolve it from a pilot instrument into a structural component of the Swiss AI ecosystem. Phase II's brief: deepen regulatory clarity, broaden into new sectors (notably healthcare), and engage with the now-actionable EU AI Act. Where Phase I focused on *computer vision*, Phase II deliberately shifted toward *generative AI* — timed after the first wave of chatbot hype had passed, so applications could be reflective rather than reactive.

## Approach & methodology
Phase II followed a portfolio approach: 8 projects initiated, 5 implemented in parallel (lightly staggered) over 9–12 months each within an 18-month window. The team kept the Phase I success formula — sector-open calls, no financial compensation for participants, no regulatory exemptions (everything within existing law), strong public communication — and added: (a) pre-application contact with interested parties to vet relevance early, (b) tighter networking via events/workshops, (c) entry into new sectors (especially health), (d) explicit engagement with EU regulation for market-access questions. Five role types around each project: test partner, mandated experts, technical implementation partner, sparring partner, supervisory authority.

## Key findings & recommendations
- **24 applications received** (vs. 21 in Phase I); selection process unchanged (written submission → 30-min validation interview → Steering Committee prioritisation).
- **Real-world testing in 3 of 5 projects** (Digital Eye Clinic, AI in Building Permits, Sensor-based Bridge Monitoring); the other two (Medical Documentation, Autonomous Inspection Robots) were limited to regulatory analysis — Medical Documentation because data-protection requirements blocked operational use of patient data in a public hospital, Inspection Robots because no suitable test partner was found.
- **Rule-based systems beat generative AI when decision logic is well-defined** (e.g. completeness checks in building permits); generative AI shines on unstructured input (summaries, transcription, plausibility pre-checks).
- **Model choice is task-specific**: no single "best" model exists across heterogeneous use cases with mixed image/text inputs; architecture should be **model-agnostic** so models can be swapped and continuously benchmarked.
- **Frontier vs. open-source is a deliberate mix**: combine cloud commercial frontier models with locally-run open-source models depending on privacy/cost/scale (especially in health).
- **Data access is the biggest lever**: even apparently trivial datasets (e.g. drone images of an airfield) yield outsized value when made publicly accessible — they let multiple providers train, validate and compare.
- **AI providers should integrate regulation into product development from the start**; late-stage regulatory fixes drive flawed business models (e.g. autonomous agricultural vehicles required full re-certification when retrofitted).
- **Continuous regulatory learning is essential**: classical licensing logics hit limits with dynamic learning systems; formats like *Regulatory Roundtables* matter beyond rigid approval logic.
- **Scaling fails on integration, not on model performance**: the pilot-to-production gap is usually missing integration into existing systems, processes and governance — not a weak model.
- **Three impact levels**: (1) direct project value for AI providers + public partners, (2) ecosystem know-how transfer (publications, prototypes like Digital Eye Clinic platform opened to third parties, Regulatory Roundtables, international networking with DE/LI/EU/NA/SA/Asia), (3) systemic anchoring (input to the Federal Council's *Bundesratsentscheid zur KI-Regulierung* / AI regulation decision, the *KI im Baubewilligungsverfahren* parliamentary postulate, sector transfer to *Educa* (education), *Swissmedic* (health), *MODI* (mobility)).

## Legal & regulatory points
- **EU AI Act** — central to the Autonomous Inspection Robots project; risk-based classification, high-risk obligations, transparency duties.
- **EU Machinery Regulation 2023/1230** (*EU-Maschinenverordnung*) — examined jointly with the AI Act for inspection-robot market access; the dynamic interdependence between the two regulations was a particular challenge.
- **ISO/IEC 42001** — AI management system standard; piloted with Modulos as an AI governance platform for the inspection-robot use case.
- **Swiss implementation of the Council of Europe AI Convention** — flagged as expanding the existing legal framework, especially where AI touches fundamental rights.
- **Swiss FADP/DSG** — central blocker in Medical Documentation (data processing of patient records).
- **Federal Council decision on AI testing environments** (*KI-Testumgebungen*) — sandboxes were specifically named as innovation-promotion instrument.
- **Cantonal Government Council Decision** (*Regierungsratsbeschluss*) on strengthening the AI location 2026–2029 — directly built on sandbox findings, anchoring four pillars: (I) AI Sandbox, (II) AI startup promotion, (III) AI adoption by SMEs, (IV) population dialogue.

## Data, models, infrastructure
The overview itself is non-technical, but it names: **MPAssist** (medical documentation provider whose use case anchored the legal guide), **ANYbotics** (Swiss inspection-robot vendor), **Modulos** (AI governance platform for ISO/IEC 42001), **irmos technologies** (sensor bridge monitoring), **Nokema / Gossweiler Ingenieure / Byte Studio** (Building Permits implementation), **IBM Research** (annotated drone-inspection dataset for infrastructure, published on **Hugging Face** as a public benchmark). The Digital Eye Clinic project produced an **open-source modular AI diagnostics platform** because no commercial product met public-hospital requirements. References to: *generative AI*, *LLMs*, *frontier models*, *computer vision*, *LLM-as-a-judge* (used for evaluating the building-permits prototype across thousands of test runs).

## Why someone planning a new AI pilot would read this specifically
This is the single most strategic document in the corpus — it explains what the sandbox *is now*, how it changed from Phase I, and the four-pillar 2026–2029 location strategy it now anchors. Without reading this, you can't speak credibly about where the sandbox is heading.

## Taxonomies the booklet hands us (load-bearing for the wiki schema)

The English booklet makes three categorisations explicit that are not derivable from the project reports alone. Treat as authoritative seed enums for the wiki.

**7-sector submission taxonomy** (figure 1, p. 6 — the buckets the steering committee used to classify the 24 submissions):
1. Mobility (traffic data, visitor tracking, sensor-based bridge monitoring)
2. Autonomous Systems (inspection robots)
3. Public Administration (semantic search, document understanding, chatbots for enquiries, AI-supported appeal decisions, chatbot for environment + social affairs)
4. Education & Work (vocational training environments, AI-based skills assessment, AI assistant for upper secondary school entrance exams)
5. Healthcare (medical documentation, AI health assistant, GenAI for symptom diagnosis, Digital Eye Clinic)
6. Construction Sector (AI assistant for construction projects, AI in building permit procedures)
7. Other (deepfake detection, humanitarian demining, raw material procurement, anti-littering tool)

**5 partner-role types around a sandbox project** (p. 8 diagram):
1. **Test partners** — provide real-world application context, data, operational environment.
2. **Technical implementation partners** — build prototypes/models/infrastructure; work closely with test partners.
3. **Mandated experts** — contribute regulatory or domain expertise within a formal mandate; deliver robust analyses.
4. **Domain sparring partners** — informal expert exchange, validation of assumptions, quality assurance without formal mandate.
5. **Supervisory authorities** — feedback from oversight perspective, early clarification of regulatory issues.

**11-term canonical glossary** (p. 26 — these are the sandbox's official term-of-art definitions; use as concept-page seeds):
Computer Vision · Deepfakes · EU AI Act · Frontier Models · Generative AI · Intrapreneurship · ISO/IEC 42001 · Large Language Models (LLMs) · LLM Benchmarks · Machinery Regulation (EU Machinery Regulation) · Real-World Testing.

## Three biggest deltas vs. Phase I (Play & Learn)
1. **Generative AI replaced computer vision as the technological centre of gravity**, but only after the team deliberately waited out the initial chatbot wave so they could test it reflectively.
2. **Healthcare became a deliberate sectoral focus** (4 of 24 applications), driven by partnership with digital health center Bülach. Two of five executed projects (Eye Clinic, Medical Documentation) were health, plus active regulatory work with Swissmedic.
3. **EU regulation moved from peripheral to central** — the Autonomous Inspection Robots project was framed entirely as an EU-AI-Act + EU-Machinery-Regulation market-access exercise, and the sandbox engaged cross-border with Germany's Bundesnetzagentur and Liechtenstein for the first time. Phase I's regulatory work was almost entirely Swiss law.

## Translation notes
- *Standortförderung* — rendered as "location promotion" (or sometimes "regional economic development"); literally the office charged with making Canton Zürich an attractive economic site. There is no clean English equivalent.
- *Befähigung des KI-Ökosystems* — "enabling the AI ecosystem"; "Befähigung" connotes both empowerment and capacity-building.
- *Regulatorisches Lernen* — "regulatory learning"; a sandbox-specific term of art meaning the iterative co-development of regulation through observed practice rather than purely top-down rulemaking.
- *Aufsichtsbehörden* — "supervisory authorities" / "regulators"; used broadly to cover both sector regulators (e.g. Swissmedic) and data-protection authorities.
- *Frontier-Modelle* — kept as "frontier models"; the German report uses the English term directly.
- *Real-World-Testing* — also kept in English in the German original.
- *Regierungsratsbeschluss* — "Cantonal Government Council decision"; the executive-branch resolution of Canton Zürich.
- *Postulat* — Swiss parliamentary instrument requesting the executive to examine a question; rendered "postulate" but a non-Swiss reader should understand it as a formal legislative motion.
- *Bundesratsentscheid zur KI-Regulierung* — "Federal Council decision on AI regulation"; the Swiss federal-level decision (Feb 2025) on how Switzerland implements the Council of Europe AI Convention.
