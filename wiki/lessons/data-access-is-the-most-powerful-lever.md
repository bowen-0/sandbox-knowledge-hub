# Data access is the most powerful lever

The clearest single-sentence cross-cutting lesson from Phase II, stated explicitly in [[00-overview-phase2-build-and-share]] §04 Technology:

> *"Data access is the most powerful lever: even seemingly simple datasets can generate substantial value for the development and optimisation of AI systems. When made accessible, they enable a wide range of providers to train, validate, and improve their models (e.g. high-resolution drone imagery of a runway)."*

## Evidence base

Data access — or its absence — drove the outcome of nearly every project in the corpus. See [[data-access]] for the project-by-project chokepoint table.

- **Positive evidence**: [[infrastructure-maintenance]] → the IBM Research dataset published on Hugging Face is the corpus's canonical case of a sandbox project generating reusable data infrastructure beyond its own engagement.
- **Negative evidence**: [[medical-documentation]] could not proceed to real-world testing because patient-data protection requirements blocked operational use in a public hospital.

## How to apply

When scoping a new public-sector AI use case:

1. **Identify the data-access blocker before the model**: partner consent, regulatory permission, pseudonymisation requirement.
2. **Plan for data reuse**: if you can derive a dataset that's safely shareable, doing so multiplies the impact beyond your own engagement.
3. **Treat partner relationships as data-access infrastructure** — they're often more load-bearing than the AI choice. See the related [[partner-bottleneck]] concept.
